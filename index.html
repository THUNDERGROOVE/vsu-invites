            <h2 style="padding-top: 190px;">What are we?</h2>
            <p>We are a unifying group of passionate Planetside2 gamers trying to build a friendly community of VS players to share tactics, coordinate games when needed and, in general, hang out with. Ideally the Union will have members and leaders from all major VS outfits across all servers. Through piloting this idea we have already been able to successfully connect serious PS2 players with outfits on their desired servers. We hold tactical discussions and help introduce new players to the game before helping connect them with outfits. We use Slack as our communication network.</p>

            <h2>Why should you join?</h2>
            <p>
            Easily find players to squad with or outfits to join
            Reserve a dedicated conversion thread for your outfit to communicate on
            Access to constructive feedback of tactics while learning from others' tactics
            Access a list of known team killers or knuckleheads who ruin the gaming experience before letting them join your team
            Send or find calls for assistance to help other outfits or players on your server
            Get access to free VoIP team chat for server leaders coordinating map alerts across your server
            </p>

            <h2>What is the risk of joining?</h2>
            <p>Nothing. If you don't like the community, just stop using it. We all know how hard it can be to play solo in PS2, though.</p>

            <h2>How do I join?</h2>
            <p>Just register to VS-U slack from the button at the top of this page. If you are an outfit leader please send a PM to one of the admins and they will sort you out so you get the right access to the tools we have in the game. To join click the slack link/button under or on the very top of the page and follow the instructions. If you cant find a link in this chapter the join proxy is most likely under maintenance so you need to come back and visit this page later.</p>
            <p style="padding-top: 50px;">To join in on Discord just click the connect button and follow the instructions.
            <p><iframe src="https://discordapp.com/widget?id=75311385696800768&theme=dark" width="350" height="500" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

            <h2>Why Slack?</h2>
            <p>With Slack, we can have ongoing conversations without the need for meeting times or everyone to be present. It is a very robust system with a multitude of capabilities. For some players, spending time on a computer to check up on things isn't a very good option. Slack offers a mobile client that is just as good as the web and OS specific clients.</p>

            <h2>Why Discord?</h2>
            <p>With Discord you have a wide range of clients to choose from for a myriad of platforms, its low demand on the client and its even got a normal web interface which is very similar to Slack so you will feel straight at home. Discord is a very new project and is easy to administer and we have an unlimited server we can use for coordinating our outfits in VS-U.</p>
